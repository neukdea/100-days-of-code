# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 28, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Laying the ground work from project 01. What's in my fridge.

**Thoughts:** Right now I am just getting my notebooks all setup, trying to get my idea out there.  
**Project Descritpion**: Goal is to have a physical kiosk in my kitchen that lists all items within my two (2) refridgerators and cubords.  - Minimume items listed should be quantity, photo, and expiration dates.
- Must be accessable via internet (with proper security built in).
- Would be cool if: (a) could add items via barcode or image; (b) recieve tweets or emails when something is about to expire, (c) search for recipies based on what you have with options to add +1,2... items in order to make.

**Link to work:** No work to link yet.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
